This is Baccarat Game.
With this statement I totally state that I have done this project by own.(MAURICIO MERCHAN)
In this folder we can find de src folder which contain all classes needed for the game.
There is also a folder called Test that contain some test functions used to test the game.

Instructions:
As you mentioned I could do it using Java, you can run it from your terminal

I created an .exe file thus you could run it directly from your terminal.

In case this exe does not work you can follow the next steps.

1. compile using the following command from your terminal.:
        javac GameTUI.java
2. run the game by using:
        java GameTUI
